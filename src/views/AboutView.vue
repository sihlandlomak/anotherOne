      <div class="text">
        <p>
          I am a dedicated and adaptable software developer who has navigated through various academic and personal experiences, shaping me into who I am today. My journey began at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), where I pursued a degree in BCom Accounting. Although I faced challenges and did not complete the program, the experience taught me valuable skills and resilience.</p>
          <p>
            In 2023, I explored the field of Education at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) before discovering my true passion for coding. This led me to join the Life Choices Coding Academy in 2024, where I immersed myself in software development. After six months of intensive learning and growth, I proudly graduated, equipped with the skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each step of my journey, from UWC to CPUT and finally to Life Choices, has prepared me for the challenges ahead. I am excited to continue developing my skills and contributing to innovative projects in the tech world.
